### A Lightweight Moisture Stress Indicator for VSP trained Vitis vinifera Grown in Sandy Soil 


ABSTRACT 

*To develop a lightweight, moisture stress indicator for irrigated, VSP trellis trained Vitis vinifera, we used traditional plant moisture parameter gathering technologies to develop a soil, plant and climate dataset for a small, California Central Coast vineyard.  We found that, when the plants have transitioned from the phase of vegetative growth to focus on developing berry maturity, and when soil moisture is limited, infrared thermometry may be used to quickly characterize moisture stress and therefore inform further irrigation scheduling decisions.*
